        Module 1: Evolution of Leadership

        - Ethical Frameworks: Values-Based, Servant Leadership, Transformational, Authentic, and Stakeholder-Centric.
        - Self-Assessment: Key dimensions are EQ, Decision-Making, Communication, Adaptability, Integrity. Core philosophy involves core values and leadership style.

        Module 6: Global Institutions & Diplomacy
        - Architecture of Global Governance: UN (Peace/norms), AU (Regional integration), IMF (Financial stability), World Bank (Development financing).
        - Diplomacy Theory: Bilateral vs Multilateral. Focus on interests, not just stated positions. BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement). Aim for Win-Win (integrative) over Zero-Sum.
